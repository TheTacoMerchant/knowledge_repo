### Bilberry
Deserted stone passages carved with the scenes of great battles, triumphs, despairs. The light flickers as two figures descend a staircase that seems to stretch on without end. The taller figure, cloaked in blackest cloth, is Murdoch. He speaks with the dwarf King Bildor of preparations for the coup. He speaks of Elven oppression and expansion.

### Isolde
An awful connectedness. Your mind cycles through images: a spider's web, an ant colony, a great ravine, a sky full of clouds all moving in their own pattern. It lands on an image of a forest so dense that the roots seem to twine together into a fabric beneath your feet.

You hear the voice of minor deity Tsin-Tsin. Speaks of unease in the land, of forces at play not of the plane, and of shifts in the tides of power not seen in many cycles. He reminds you that while the Order is foremost in devotion to Scythia, he presides over all equally, and entrusts us all to forge our own path.

### Finnian

A beautiful opulent gala. Guest in mask swirl and sweep accross the dancefloor. Tables at the sides of the room are piled high with foods of all description. All guest are elves of the highest class, with the only other races present being some staff, hidden away in corners and serving drinks.

At the end of a room sits a man surrounded by women, some wearing beautiful jewels and fabrics, some wearing little at all. The man wears a mask as well, but this jaw, his build, and his black hair are strikingly familiar. He looks just like you.

### Bromin

A vision of your father, hammering at his anvil. His workshop is shabby, but in perfect order. He puts the final touches on a fine, if somewhat plain dwarven pick. He sets it down next to what looks like a dozen more identical pieces. You recall how your father used to take such pride in his fine craftsmanship and attention to detail. You see him look at the pile, and his eyes are more tired than you remember. Your mother walks in, and they have a long embrace. Your minds eye shifts down deeper into the keep, into the mines underneath, the shafts seem to extend deeper than you remember, deeper, deeper, deeper...
