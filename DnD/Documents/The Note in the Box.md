Kamilla, all is prepared. When the operation is confirmed successful, we will begin our first shipment of Mithril to the port at Harden, with the rest following on soon after. I won't remind you that time is of the essence. The vultures and crows will scatter at the initial explosion, but it won't be long till they regroup and close rank. We must be ready when they do.
